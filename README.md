# P2PRaster - Distributed Contraction Grid-based Clustering

Peer-to-peer simulator implementing two distributed clustering algorithm proposals based on the sequential [RASTER](https://gregorulm.com/new-preprint-contraction-clustering-raster-a-very-fast-big-data-algorithm-for-sequential-and-parallel-density-based-clustering-in-linear-time-constant-memory-and-a-single-pass/) algorithm.

## Requirements

For building and running the application you need:

- [Boost](https://www.boost.org)
- [Igraph](https://igraph.org/2014/04/21/igraph-0.7.1-c.html)
